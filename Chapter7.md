# Chapter 7: Service Discovery
# What Is Service Discovery?
Service discovery solves the problem of figuring out which process is listening on which address/port for which service.

In a good service discovery system:
* users can retrieve info quickly
* informs users of changes to services
* low latency
* richer definition of what the service is (not sure what this means)

# The Service Object
- a way to create a named label selector
- created using `kubectl expose`
- Each service is assigned a virtual IP called cluster IP - the system load balances across this IP all the pods identified by the same selector

Kubernetes itself creates and runs a service called `kubernetes` which lets the components in your app talk to other components such as the API server.

## Service DNS
- k8s inbuilt DNS service maps cluster IPs to DNS names
- installed as a system component when the cluster is created, managed by k8s
- Within a namespace, any pod belonging to a service can be targeted just by using the service name

## Readiness Checks
The `Service` objects also tracks when your pods are ready to handle requests.

```
spec:
  ...
  template:
    ...
    spec:
      containers:
        ...
        name: alpaca-prod
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /ready
            port: 8080
          periodSeconds: 2
          initialDelaySeconds: 0
          failureThreshold: 3
          successThreshold: 1
```

I we add the `readinessProbe` section to our YAML for the deployment, then the pods created by this deployment will be checked at the `/ready` endpoint on port 8080. As soon as the pod comes up, we hit that end point every 2 seconds. If one check succeeds, the pod will be considered ready. However, if three checks fail in succession, itâ€™ll not be considered ready. Requests from you application are only sent to pods that are ready.

# Looking Beyond the Cluster
To allow traffic from outside the cluster to reach it, we use something known as `NodePorts`.
- This feature assigns a specific port to the service along with the cluster IP
- Whenever any node in this cluster receives a request on this port, it automatically forwards it to the service
- If you can reach any node in the cluster, you can reach the service too, without knowing where any of its pods are running
